For the motion detection,we built an infrastructure to collect the digital data(i.e. 0 or 1 ).
we can built a similar infrastructure to store the analog values.

using this infrastructure we can build devices like Blood Sugar notifier for diabetic peoples, where the Iot devices(in this case CGM(contineous glucose meter)(it is an
implant placed in the pancreatic glands to read the insulin levels.)) can 
to read the data and we can store it in the google sheets(cloud storage).
There is a man named Scott Hanselman who created a similar devices and also connected the insulin pump to his arm. When his blood sugar levels differ by a certian 
range, the IoT devices notifies him and directly pumps insulin in his arm.
Blood sugar level also spikes due to stress.
The stored data(throughout the day) in the cloud can also be visualized in a graphical manner to locate the time frames where stress is caused.

in the similar manner we can use this infrastructure to collect the heartbeat data using a heartbeat sensor. By analyzing this data we can find out the activity level 
of the user throughout the day, ny giving them  a end of the day analysis. Using machine learning we can also pick out the abnormality in the data caused by 
minor heart failures or irregular beats.
