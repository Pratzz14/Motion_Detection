This is a code for working IoT Motion Detector.
In this we used PIR sensor, ESP8266 WiFi-module, Bandwidth source and IFTTT services.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When the PIR sensor scans for the motion and the data is send to the ESP8266 module. When the motion is detected, it pings the IFTTT servers.
This triggers two of their services, one of which updates the Google sheets with date and time of the motion and the second sends a notification to the user from the IFTTT app.
